    <h1><em> JOHN WICK: CHAPTER <em></h1>
      <p><strong>John Wick (retroactively known as John Wick: Chapter 1)</strong> is a 2014 American neo-noir action-thriller
        film directed by Chad Stahelski, in his directorial debut, and written by Derek Kolstad.
        It stars Keanu Reeves, Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Adrianne Palicki, Bridget Moynahan,
        Dean Winters, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo, and Willem Dafoe. It is the first installment 
        in the John Wick film series.
       The story focuses on John Wick (Reeves) searching for the men who broke into his home, 
        stole his vintage car and killed his puppy, which was a last gift to him from his recently 
        deceased wife (Moynahan). Stahelski and David Leitch directed the film together, though only 
        Stahelski was credited.
       Kolstad had completed the screenplay in 2012 and further developed it for Thunder Road Pictures.
        The film was produced by Basil Iwanyk of Thunder Road Pictures, Leitch, Eva Longoria, and Michael Witherill.
        It marks Stahelski and Leitch's directorial debut as a team after multiple separate credits as second-unit 
        directors and stunt coordinators. They previously worked with Reeves as stunt doubles on The Matrix trilogy.
